# Read it, Baby! ðŸ‘¶

## Description:

Read it, baby! Takes the hustle of researching age appropriate books away, so that parents can
spend more time with their children. 
<br><br>
Our country is facing a concerning trend of declining literacy rates, and one significant factor
contributing to this issue is the lack of reading during infancy and childhood. The early years
of a child's life are crucial for language development, cognitive growth, and literacy skills
acquisition. However, with the rise of digital distractions and reduced emphasis on reading,
many children are missing out on the transformative power of books. When children are not
exposed to reading at an early age, they are more likely to struggle with language
comprehension, vocabulary development, and critical thinking later in life. This lack of reading
in infancy and childhood hinders their ability to excel academically and participate fully in
society. Furthermore, it perpetuates a cycle of low literacy rates across generations, widening
the gap between those who have access to quality education and those who do not. To
reverse this trend, it is essential to promote and prioritize reading initiatives that encourage
parents, caregivers, and educators to engage children in reading from an early age. By
instilling a love for reading in infancy and childhood, we can foster a literate society that
thrives on knowledge, imagination, and lifelong learning.
